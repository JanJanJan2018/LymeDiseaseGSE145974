The catalytic portion of mitochondrial ATP synthase consists of 5 different subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon) assembled with a stoichiometry of 3 alpha, 3 beta, and a single representative of the other 3. The proton channel seems to have nine subunits (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, F6 and 8). This gene is one of three genes that encode subunit c of the proton channel. Each of the three genes have distinct mitochondrial import sequences but encode the identical mature protein.

"OAS2","protein","ENSG00000111335","This gene encodes a member of the 2-5A synthetase family, essential proteins involved in the innate immune response to viral infection. The encoded protein is induced by interferons and uses adenosine triphosphate in 2'-specific nucleotidyl transfer reactions to synthesize 2',5'-oligoadenylates (2-5As). These molecules activate latent RNase L, which results in viral RNA degradation and the inhibition of viral replication. The three known members of this gene family are located in a cluster on chromosome 12. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.

Activated by detection of double stranded RNA (dsRNA): polymerizes higher oligomers of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP which then bind to the inactive monomeric form of ribonuclease L (RNASEL) leading to its dimerization and subsequent activation (PubMed:10464285, PubMed:9880569, PubMed:11682059). Activation of RNASEL leads to degradation of cellular as well as viral RNA, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus terminating viral replication (PubMed:10464285, PubMed:9880569). Can mediate the antiviral effect via the classical RNASEL-dependent pathway or an alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNASEL (PubMed:21142819). In addition, it may also play a role in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, differentiation and gene regulation (PubMed:21142819). May act as a negative regulator of lactation, stopping lactation in virally infected mammary gland lobules, thereby preventing transmission of viruses to neonates (By similarity). Non-infected lobules would not be affected, allowing efficient pup feeding during infection (By similarity).
