"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis). This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q.

The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis). This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q.

The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"TSIX","immune",NA,"In mammals, dosage compensation of genes on the X chromosome occurs by X inactivation, which is regulated in cis by the X-inactivation center (XIC) and expression of the XIST non-coding RNA. This gene expresses a non-coding antisense transcript across the 3' end of the XIST locus, and is coexpressed with XIST only from the inactive X chromosome. The mouse ortholog of this locus is required for imprinted X inactivation in extraembryonic tissues and silences Xist through modification of the chromatin structure in the Xist promoter region. In contrast, imprinted X inactivation does not occur in human extraembryonic tissues and transcripts from this locus do not repress XIST expression or affect random X chromosome inactivation in embryonic cells.

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA.

The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a replication-dependent histone that is a member of the histone H2A family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a palindromic termination element. This gene is found in a histone cluster on chromosome 1. This gene is one of four histone genes in the cluster that are duplicated; this record represents the centromeric copy.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis). This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q.

The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"TSIX","immune",NA,"In mammals, dosage compensation of genes on the X chromosome occurs by X inactivation, which is regulated in cis by the X-inactivation center (XIC) and expression of the XIST non-coding RNA. This gene expresses a non-coding antisense transcript across the 3' end of the XIST locus, and is coexpressed with XIST only from the inactive X chromosome. The mouse ortholog of this locus is required for imprinted X inactivation in extraembryonic tissues and silences Xist through modification of the chromatin structure in the Xist promoter region. In contrast, imprinted X inactivation does not occur in human extraembryonic tissues and transcripts from this locus do not repress XIST expression or affect random X chromosome inactivation in embryonic cells.

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA.

The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a replication-dependent histone that is a member of the histone H2A family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a palindromic termination element. This gene is found in a histone cluster on chromosome 1. This gene is one of four histone genes in the cluster that are duplicated; this record represents the centromeric copy.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis). This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q.

KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis). This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q.

KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis). This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q.

KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis). This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q.

KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

"IL8","immune","ENSG00000169429","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis). This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q.

KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals.

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

"KIR2DS1","immune","OMIM: 604952","Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several ""framework"" genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.

This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.

"TSIX","immune",NA,"In mammals, dosage compensation of genes on the X chromosome occurs by X inactivation, which is regulated in cis by the X-inactivation center (XIC) and expression of the XIST non-coding RNA. This gene expresses a non-coding antisense transcript across the 3' end of the XIST locus, and is coexpressed with XIST only from the inactive X chromosome. The mouse ortholog of this locus is required for imprinted X inactivation in extraembryonic tissues and silences Xist through modification of the chromatin structure in the Xist promoter region. In contrast, imprinted X inactivation does not occur in human extraembryonic tissues and transcripts from this locus do not repress XIST expression or affect random X chromosome inactivation in embryonic cells.

"XIST","immune",NA,"X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.
